Expressions:
Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that yield a result.
Examples: 5 + 3, x * y, name + " Doe".
Statements:
Statements are complete lines of code that perform an action.
Examples: print("Hello, World!"), x = 10, if x > 0: print("Positive").

Order of Operations:
PEMDAS Rule:
Parentheses
Exponents (or powers)
Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

result = 5 + 3 * 2 ** 2 / 4
# Follows PEMDAS: 5 + 12 / 4 = 5 + 3.0 = 8.0
print(result)

String Operations:
Concatenation:
python
Copy code
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
String Methods:
python
Copy code
# Length of a string
length = len(full_name)

# Uppercase and lowercase
uppercase_name = full_name.upper()
lowercase_name = full_name.lower()

# Substring
substring = full_name[0:4]  # "John"
